# ${codegenName} Component Generation Orchestration

When the user references this rule document, the system will execute component generation according to the following workflow:

1. Design component specification (Component Design)
2. Generate component code based on the design

**Important Notes:**

- The required step files must be read completely step by step, and only after one step is completed can the next step file be read
- Each step should be executed sequentially to ensure proper component generation
- Do not load all step file contents at once - read them progressively as needed

## State Management and Execution Mechanism

The system will maintain the following state variables:

- \`current_step\`: The current execution step (1-2)
- \`user_requirements\`: User's component requirements or design draft
- \`component_design\`: Component design information from step 1
- \`component_code\`: Generated component code from step 2

### Complete Step File Reading Mechanism

Since step files may exceed the single reading limit, the system will:

1. **Use multi-segment reading**: Read each step file completely in multiple times, without omitting any content
2. **Verify completeness**: Ensure the step file has been completely read by checking the end of file content
3. **Maintain context**: Maintain the overall context and coherence of the step file when reading multiple segments

## Step Details

### Step 1: Design Component Specification

**Trigger condition**: \`current_step = 1\` and the user has provided component requirements

**Actions**:

1. Completely read the \`step1.md\` file content from this Skill directory (\`.claude/skills/${folderName}/step1.md\`)
2. Apply this rule to design the component and extract required information
3. Update \`component_design\` and proceed to the next step

**Key Activities in Step 1**:
- Use MCP tool \`compoder component-list\` to get available components
- Extract component name, description, and required libraries/components
- Generate component design specification in markdown format

### Step 2: Generate Component Code

**Trigger condition**: \`current_step = 2\` and \`component_design\` is not empty

**Actions**:

1. Completely read the \`step2.md\` file content from this Skill directory (\`.claude/skills/${folderName}/step2.md\`)
2. Apply this rule to generate the component code
3. Save the generated code to appropriate files in the directory confirmed by the user

**Key Activities in Step 2**:
- Use MCP tool \`compoder component-detail\` to get component API documentation
- Ask user to confirm target directory before creating files
- Create actual component files using write tool (not XML format)
- Implement component with Tailwind CSS styling and responsive design

## Important Notes

1. Step files will be loaded as needed, and will not load all step contents at once
2. Each step file will be read completely, without omitting content due to line number limitations
3. State variables are continuously maintained throughout the workflow to ensure coherence between steps
4. After each step is completed, print the value of \`current_step\` and inform the user what the next step will be

## Usage

When using this Skill, provide the component requirements or design draft first, and the system will automatically start executing from step 1.

**Skill File Structure**:
- \`SKILL.md\` (this file) - Main orchestration controller
- \`step1.md\` - Component design phase instructions (read on demand)
- \`step2.md\` - Component implementation phase instructions (read on demand)

# ${codegenName} Component Generation Orchestration Rules

When the user references this rule document, the system will execute component generation according to the following workflow:

1. Design component specification (Component Design)
2. Generate component code based on the design

Note:

- The required rule files must be read completely step by step, and only after one step is completed can the next rule file be read
- Each step should be executed sequentially to ensure proper component generation

## State Management and Execution Mechanism

The system will maintain the following state variables:

- \`current_step\`: The current execution step (1-2)
- \`user_requirements\`: User's component requirements or design draft
- \`component_design\`: Component design information from step 1
- \`component_code\`: Generated component code from step 2

### Complete Rule File Reading Mechanism

Since rule files may exceed the single reading limit, the system will:

1. **Use multi-segment reading**: Read each rule file completely in multiple times, without omitting any content
2. **Verify completeness**: Ensure the rule file has been completely read by checking the end of file content
3. **Maintain context**: Maintain the overall context and coherence of the rule file when reading multiple segments

## Step Details

### Step 1: Design Component Specification

**Trigger condition**: \`current_step = 1\` and the user has provided component requirements

**Actions**:

1. Completely read the \`./.cursor/rules/compoder/${folderName}/step1.md\` file content
2. Apply this rule to design the component and extract required information
3. Update \`component_design\` and proceed to the next step

### Step 2: Generate Component Code

**Trigger condition**: \`current_step = 2\` and \`component_design\` is not empty

**Actions**:

1. Completely read the \`./.cursor/rules/compoder/${folderName}/step2.md\` file content
2. Apply this rule to generate the component code
3. Save the generated code to appropriate files in the current directory

## Notes

1. The system will load rule files as needed, and will not load all rule contents at once
2. Each rule file will be read completely, without omitting content due to line number limitations
3. State variables are continuously maintained throughout the workflow to ensure coherence between steps
4. After each step is completed, the value of current_step should be printed, and the user should be informed of what the next step will be

You MUST create actual files directly using the file writing tools. Do NOT:
- Use XML format (e.g., <ComponentArtifact>, <ComponentFile>)
- Use code blocks with file paths as documentation
- Output code in any wrapper format

BEFORE creating any files:
1. **Ask the user to confirm the target directory** where files should be saved
2. Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
3. Once confirmed, create each file separately using the write tool

When creating component files:
1. Use the write tool to create each file with its full path
2. Use appropriate file extensions (.tsx, .ts, .css, etc.)
3. Include complete, production-ready code in each file
4. Ensure all imports and exports are correct
5. Follow the file structure specified below

`

  const defaultFileStructure = `${IMPORTANT_NOTE}Create component files with the following structure:

**Main Component File** (\`ComponentName.tsx\`):
- Main component implementation
- Split into multiple files if exceeds 500 lines
- Export the component

**App Entry File** (\`App.tsx\`):
- Import the component
- Define mock data/props
- Render the component with mock data

**Helper Functions** (\`helpers.ts\`, optional):
- Utility functions used by the component

**Type Definitions** (\`interface.ts\`):
- TypeScript interfaces for component props
- All API-interacting data must be defined as props:
  - initialData for component initialization
  - onChange, onSave, onDelete etc. for data modifications

    - \`libraryName\` (string): The library name (e.g., "pageui", "shadcn")
    - \`componentNames\` (array): Array of component names to get details for
  - Returns: Detailed API documentation including props, usage examples, and best practices

## Workflow

1. Review the component design from Step 1
2. If the design includes private components, use the \`compoder component-detail\` MCP tool to get their API documentation
3. **IMPORTANT: Ask the user to confirm the target directory** for saving files
   - Present the current working directory as the default option
   - Wait for user's explicit confirmation or alternative directory path
   - Do NOT proceed to file creation without confirmation
4. Once directory is confirmed, create the component files using the write tool
5. Implement the component logic according to the requirements
6. Ensure all style and additional rules are followed
7. Create an App.tsx entry file with mock data to demonstrate the component

**Remember**: 
- Do NOT use XML format or any wrapper syntax
- ALWAYS ask for directory confirmation before creating files
- Create actual files directly using the write tool

Please implement the component based on the design from Step 1.
